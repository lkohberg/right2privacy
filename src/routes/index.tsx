                    The European Union. The same institution that lectures the world about human rights is trying to
                    force every messenger on the continent to scan your private conversations before they are even
                    encrypted. They call it "Chat Control." Strip away the PR and it is a mandatory wiretap on 450
                    million people. Every message, every photo, every voice note, pre-screened by an algorithm that
                    answers to a bureaucrat you never voted for.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    They wave dead children in your face to sell it, because they know no honest argument survives ten
                    seconds of scrutiny. Mass-scanning does not catch predators. Predators already use tools this law
                    cannot touch. It catches <em>you</em>. Your medical photos. Your union chat. Your affair. Your
                    therapy venting. Your jokes taken out of context by a model with a 90% false-positive rate,
                    forwarded to a stranger in an office, and archived forever.

                  <p>
                    A government that demands the right to read every private sentence before it is spoken is not a
                    democracy with a security problem. It is an authoritarian project with a marketing department. The
                    Stasi kept paper files on a third of East Germany and were considered monstrous for it. Brussels
                    wants real-time client-side scanning on everyone, and calls it progress.

                  <p>
                    Right2Privacy exists because we refuse to negotiate our Rights, we demand them. The math does not
                    care about your directive. Big Brother now does. If the "legal" messengers are compromised by
                    decree, we will encrypt on top of them, underneath them, around them. Until the wiretap sees nothing
                    but noise. Paste the ciphertext into Discord, into Signal, into a postcard if you have to. Let them
                    scan it. Let them choke on it. Show them the ultimate <em>Middle Finger</em>.
